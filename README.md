# Stock Prediction using ML Algorithms
AI&ML techniques are being used with data mining to solve a plethora of real-world problems, and the prediction of the stock market is one of them. The stock market is one of the most complicated and lucrative businesses. Many other businesses depend on the stock market to generate revenue. Today, not only traders but Computer Engineers are also highly interested in predicting stock price. This can be done in two ways. First, by using previous stock data, and second, by analysing social media behaviour. However, this paper proposes to use various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, ARIMA, neural network, and SVR to predict future stock prices using previous stock data. These ML algorithms use different open-source libraries and preexisting algorithms to make this highly unpredictable stock market, a little more predictable. In comparison to the traditional approach, this technique has proven to be more accurate, and it saves time and money also. The implementation of these algorithms shows some good results at the end. Further, this paper suggests some measures that can be taken to improve the accuracy of the models.

### Running the Models

The project is built in components, so each component can be run separately to test a different model. All the models were built and run on jupyter notebooks, so they can be run by downloading and running the jupyter notebooks.

### Getting the Data

The data for all the initial implementations is pulled directly from online sources by the jupyter notebooks.

### Comparing Models

The initial implementations don't all use the same stock ticker, so the comparisions between models are unreliable for now. The accuracy or error of a model derived from its test and train data samples is still meaningful.
