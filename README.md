### Running the Models

The project is built in components, so each component can be run separately to test a different model. All the models were built and run on jupyter notebooks, so they can be run by downloading and running the jupyter notebooks.

### Getting the Data

The data for all the initial implementations is pulled directly from online sources by the jupyter notebooks.

### Comparing Models

The initial implementations don't all use the same stock ticker, so the comparisions between models are unreliable for now. The accuracy or error of a model derived from its test and train data samples is still meaningful.
